In part 2 of the assessment students should develop upon the initial work they have completed in part one, seeking to improve the model using techniques such as exploring alternative models, optimizing the model by tuning its hyperparameters, handling class imbalances (if applicable), and exploring feature engineering techniques.
Like part 1 students are required to submit an updated notebook(.ipynb) with an accompanying pickle file for any new or updated models. 
In addition, groups should include a short reflective summary within their updated notebook (Max 1000 words) outlining the following: 
• A justification for implementing any preprocessing techniques
• Model selections and performance evaluations (Why did you choose specific models, Were they effective, etc?)
• A reflection on the groups approach to addressing the data mining task, key takeaways and potential improvements for the future. 

Part 2 - A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing:
• Updated code used for improving task performance.
• An updated model and accompanying pickle file (please do not submit multiple models, pick the best or most suitable model).
• A short reflective summary as outlined in Section 2, part 2.
